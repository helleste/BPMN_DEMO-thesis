@book{Dietz2006,
abstract = {If one thing catches the eye in almost all literature about (re)designing or (re)engineering of enterprises, it is the lack of a well-founded theory about their construction and operation. Often even the most basic notions like "action" or "process" are not precisely defined. Next, in order to master the diversity and the complexity of contemporary enterprises, theories are needed that separate the stable essence of an enterprise from the variable way in which it is realized and implemented. Such a theory and a matching methodology, which has passed the test of practical experience, constitute the contents of this book. The enterprise ontology, as developed by Dietz, is the starting point for profoundly understanding the organization of an enterprise and subsequently for analyzing, (re)designing, and (re)engineering it. The approach covers numerous issues in an integrated way: business processes, in- and outsourcing, information systems, management control, staffing etc. Researchers and students in enterprise engineering or related fields will discover in this book a revolutionary new way of thinking about business and organization. In addition, it provides managers, business analysts, and enterprise information system designers for the first time with a solid and integrated insight into their daily work.},

abstract = {Many business process modeling techniques have been proposed over the last decades, creating a demand for theory to assist in the comparison and evaluation of these techniques. A widely established way of determining the effectiveness and efficiency of modeling techniques is by way of representational analysis. This paper comparatively assesses representational analyses of 12 popular process modeling techniques in order to provide insights into the extent to which they differ from each other. We discuss several implications of our findings. Our analysis uncovers and explores representational root causes for a number of shortcomings that remain in process modeling practice, such as lack of process decomposition and integration of business rule specification. Our findings also serve as motivation and input to future research in areas such as context-aware business process design and conventions management.},

In this article, the author defines enterprise engineering as an interdisciplinary field and discusses the role of modeling and simulation and its potential in enterprise engineering. In particular, the author discusses an innovative method for enterprise modeling and simulation and the underling theory. Because complexity is a growing challenge in modern enterprises, in the proposed method the author also demonstrates how to reduce complexity of models by capturing only the essential enterprise business processes and excluding from the model's scope nonessential processes and implementation concerns. The theoretical underpinning and worldview of the proposed method is that enterprises are essentially social systems whose elements are human actors.},

Solving this problem means to find out how to consistently place the software specification model on a previously developed business process model. If considering in particular the UML-based software design, we need to answer in this regard a fundamental question, namely how to find all relevant use cases, based on sound business process modeling? Adopting the business process modeling as a basis for identification of use cases has been studied from three perspectives Language/Action Perspective, Organizational Semiotics and Petri Net. The goal of the current paper is to study and analyze the strengths of DEMO concerning the derivation of use cases. This could be helpful not only for the investigation of DEMO but also for the further activities directed towards finding out the most appropriate way(s) of identifying use cases from business processes.},

@article{VanNuffel2009,
abstract = {Recently, business processes are receiving more attention as process-centric representations of an enterprise. This paper focuses on the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), that is becoming an industry standard. However, BPMN has some drawbacks such as the lack of formal semantics, limited potential for verification, and ambiguous description of the constructs. Also the ontology used to model is mostly kept implicit. As a result, BPMN models may be ambiguous, inconsistent or incomplete. In order to overcome these limitations, a contribution to BPMN is proposed by applying the way of thinking of DEMO; the explicit specified Enterprise ontology axioms and the rigid modeling methodology of DEMO. Adding the ontological concepts which, in DEMO, are translated into a coherent set of modeling symbols, may result in formal, unambiguous BPMN business process models. As such BPMN can be enriched on several aspects like the diagnosis, consistency, and optimalization of business processes.},

But creating models that are correct, complete, and clear demands more than a dictionary of BPMN shapes and symbols. It also requires a methodology for translating process logic consistently into the diagram. And it requires a measure of modeling style as well, conventions that ensure that the process logic is unambiguous from the diagram by itself. In short, "good BPMN" requires a disciplined approach called "method and style."},

Business transactions focus on specifying the pattern-based behaviour resulting from the collaboration between actors and systems while services and products are being requested and provided. The method makes possible assessing the consistency of a business process in terms of the business transactions that can be inferred from it. To do so, it takes as input a process model that is converted to a transactional model. The transactional model is then analysed and revised so that all transactions become consistent according to the pat-terns of DEMO. Finally, the original process model is revised to comply with the transactional model. As a result, the revised business process becomes consistent with the corresponding transactional model.},
